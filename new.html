			<div class="text">
				I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a focus on JavaScript Ruby and MEAN Stack. I am passionate about new technologies and new skills and I plan to utilize that passion to fully dedicate my life to what I love: making things.
				<br>
				Previously, I worked for one of the top U.S. creative advertising agencies focused on multicultural markets. My experience taught me how to work with groups built on diversity producing creativity. I specialized in digital marketing, social media strategies, and social content production, which introduced me to the world of web application development. Since then, I've been able to refocus my professional development in this dynamic field and learn what it takes to translate creative ideas into reality.
				<br>
				My goal is to work full-time as a web developer and I am open to front-end, back-end, and full stack positions.  In addition to the hard skills that I acquired in my previous roles, my background also gives me a robust knowledge of clients' wants, which will be very helpful for any company producing web applications on behalf of clients.  Above all, I am eager to learn how the technology industry works from the inside and show my new employer that hiring me was one of the best decision he/she made!
